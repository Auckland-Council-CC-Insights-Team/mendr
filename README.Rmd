The goal of mendr is to simplify the task of creating a calendar of dates for a
recurring process.

## Installation

You can install the development version of mendr from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Auckland-Council-CC-Insights-Team/mendr")
```

## Example

Create a schedule for the first three months of 2023, allowing for non-working
days at Auckland Council.

```{r example}
library(mendr)
# Create a calendar of Auckland Council's known non-working days
create_calendar()

# Create a data frame of tasks and offsets. Alternatively, you could
# read in an Excel file here.
 tasks <- data.frame(
   tasks = c("Send email reminder", "Extract data", "Run report"),
   offsets = c(-2, 0, 1)
   )

# Pass the data frame to `create_schedule` to create a schedule for the first
# three months of 2023
create_schedule(
  schedule_data = tasks,
  starting_month = "2023-01",
  iterations = 3
  )
```
